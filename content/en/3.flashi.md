# Flashi

Flashi is a program currently in development. Tauri and Flutter are the two main technologies responsible for this application. My main goal is to create a modern alternative to the AutoHotKey program. The application is currently in a very early stage of development and is only accessible to a small testing group. I hope to present its open beta by the end of 2024.

Flashi is a free program for automating tasks on your computer. It operates by creating scripts that allow you to perform various actions, such as text input, file opening, or mouse actions. These scripts can be triggered using keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks, and with the application, you can do this remotely.
